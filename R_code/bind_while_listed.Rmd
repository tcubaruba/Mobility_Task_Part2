This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
whitelist <- fread("white_list.csv")
whitelist <- select(whitelist, userid, tripid)
whitelist <- paste0(whitelist$userid, "_", whitelist$tripid)

output.dir <- "segments/"

list.files(output.dir)

tmp <- NULL
# tmp2 <- NULL
for(w in whitelist) {
  f <- list.files(output.dir)[startsWith(list.files(output.dir), w)]
  
  if(length(f) != 0) {
    right <- fread(paste0(output.dir, f))
    right$time_ms <- bit64::as.integer64(right$time_ms)
    print(right)
    tmp <- rbind(tmp, right)
  } 
  # else {
  #   tmp2 <- c(tmp2, w)
  # }
}
write_csv(tmp, "final/all_segments.csv")

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
